ESTEID PLUGIN LOADER
====================

Esteid plugin loader is a JavaScript library for loading the 
esteid-browser-plugin into a web page. The library has fallback
capabilities which can utilize all known estonian ID-card
signer methods. A transparent API converter will make those old
technologies behave the same as the new plugin. All known signers
will be automatically probed for and the best one will be enabled.
No user input or "signing preference" is required. Legacy support is
encapsulated into a separate JS file and designed in a way that it's
easy to remove when old plugins finally fade out of existence.
