Description: SmartCard utilities with support for PKCS#15 compatible cards
 This package includes utilities for manipulating
 PKCS#15 compatible smart cards and similar security tokens
 with the libopensc libraries.
 .
 These utilities allow the user to initialize, personalize and
 otherwise manipulate PKCS#15 cards with PINs and cryptographic 
 keys. Users can sign and decrypt data with private keys 
 residing on-card.
 .
 Supported cards include Gemplus GPK, Schlumberger Cryptoflex,
 Finnish FINEID, Swedish eID, MioCOS and TCOS cards.
