CSP or [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380245(VS.85).aspx Certificate Service Provider] has to be signed by Microsoft.
Of course during development for every test there is no point sending the DLLs to Microsoft for signing.
To switch off signature check you have to use HEX editor on advapi32.dll located in System32 folder.
It is a "very necessary" system file ([http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/archive/wfp.mspx Read here]) so Windows tries to stop you from replacing it in any way. While working you cannot write a file there, renaming does not work (the old one is back after system restart) and to top it all off there are many copies of the file in the system.

*NB! If you did not understand the text before then do not try to mess with your system.
You will probably fail and worst case scenario is that you will ruin Windows completely and have to install everything from the scratch.*

We would gladly upload already made dll-s for the interested parties to download but that would sadly be software piracy.
So you have to make the necessary files yourself.
For starters you need HEX editor. On Windows platform we have used [http://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/ HxD]. Under Linux for file editing ghex or khexeditor is good enough, old school hackers have [http://www.hiew.ru Hiew] somewhere in their drawers.

 * Copy advapi32.dll from System32 to a safe place (like c:\advapi32 folder)
 * Make a backup copy of the file (like c:\advapi32\normal.dll)
 * Right click on the file and find the DLL version number. You need that to check your next moves.
 * Open the copied file with HEX editor
 * Replace some bytes according to your Windows DLL version (check below)
 * For 64bit Windows do the same with advapi32.dll in the SysWOW64 folder
 * Turn off your computer and hook your hard drive to a different machine with the *same*  Windows version (when using a newer one NTFS might be updated irreplaceably, older one might not be able to read the newer NTFS)
 * Replace System32\advapi32.dll with the edited version
 * For 64bit Windows do the same with advapi32.dll in the SysWOW64 folder
 * Delete other copies from the system
  * System32\dllcache\advapi32.dll
  * etc.
 * Start the system and start from the command line:
{{{
SFC /SCANNOW
}}}
 * If you are notified that damaged files were found but could not be fixed then in all likelyhood you were successful.
 * Connect the reader to the computer and insert ID card
 * Try if EstEIDCSP works with a command
{{{
testac enumcont
}}}
 * If the patching was unsuccessful you will get a message:
{{{
cryptError  exception:'CryptoApiError' code:'0x80090006'
}}}
 * If that happened then open advapi32.dll again with the HEX editor and see if your changes are still there or did Windows replace the old file.

NB! The internet has all kinds of stories that Safe mode and/or Recovery console work for patching advapi32.dll. *They do not work*! One working alternative is BartPE LiveCD but looking for, copying and replacing files on the "real computer" is definitely much more comfortable.

NB! For 64 bit Windows there is a 64 bit file in System32 folder and *32 bit file in SysWOW64 folder* but if you were doing this then you already knew that right? :)
