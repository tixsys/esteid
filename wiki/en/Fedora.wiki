= Fedora =

Supported versions *12* and *13* 


=== Card reader drivers ===

When first installing software you need to also install CCID reader drivers
{{{
sudo yum install ccid
}}}

By default fedora uses OpenCT as the reader driver which is broken. To fix this when installing for the first time do the following:
{{{
sudo chkconfig openct off
sudo chkconfig pcscd on
sudo /etc/init.d/openct stop
sudo /etc/init.d/pcscd start
}}}

=== Adding to the repository ===

When first installing software you must add a configuration file to the repository and import the GPG key. Both of those come with the esteid-release package which you can get from: 

When using Fedora12: http://id.smartlink.ee/repo/release/fedora/12/i386/esteid-release-12-0.6.noarch.rpm

When using Fedora13: http://id.smartlink.ee/repo/release/fedora/13/i386/esteid-release-13-0.6.noarch.rpm


=== Installing packages ===

To install all packages enter the following commands into the terminal:
{{{
sudo yum update
sudo yum install qesteidutil qdigidoc mozilla-esteid thunderbird-esteid openoffice.org-digidoc
}}}

If the packages have already been installed before then to update them enter the following command into the terminal:
{{{
sudo yum update
}}}

PS: If the system can not find the card reader, make sure that the package pcsc-lite-openct is not  installed. If it is use the command:
{{{
sudo yum remove pcsc-lite-openct
}}}
