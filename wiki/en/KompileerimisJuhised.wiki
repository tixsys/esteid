= Want to be a programmer?! Cool! =

For starters you need the source texts.
You can read them from this web page by choosing "Browse Source" from the top menu.

You need a SVN client to get the source texts.

Under Linux it is simple: command line SVN to the rescue.

Windows users should download [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org TortoiseSVN].

If you are using a development environment called [http://www.eclipse.org Eclipse] then that also has a SVN module (subclipse, you can install from  where the other Eclipse extensions can be found).

= Download the necessary piece =
If you have decided what you are going to poke at direct the SVN client to the address:
https://id.eesti.ee/svn/ModuleName
For example:
{{{
svn co https://id.eesti.ee/svn/libdigidocpp/trunk libdigidocpp
}}}
Then compile the piece you chose with CMake.
For example:
{{{
cd libdigidocpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
}}}
