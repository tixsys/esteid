# This file contains custom definitions of the XML schema types and
# C/C++ types for your project, and XML namespace prefix definitions.
# XML namespace prefix definitions can be provided to override the
# default choice of ns1, ns2, ... prefixes. For example:
i = "http://www.soapinterop.org/"
s = "http://www.soapinterop.org/xsd"
ds = "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#"
xenc = "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#"
mss = "http://uri.etsi.org/TS102204/v1.1.2#"
xs = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

# Type definitions consists of a single line containing:
# type = declaration | use | pointer-use
# where
# type is the XML schema type (or an application type in a namespace
# that has a prefix definition given as above).
# declaration is an optional C/C++ type declaration
# use is how the type is referred to in code
# pointer-use is how the type should be referred to as a pointer (opt)
# Example XML schema and C/C++ type bindings:
xsd int = | int
xsd byte = | char | int*
xsd boolean = enum xsd boolean false , true ; | enum xsd boolean
xsd base64Binary = class xsd base64Binary unsigned char * ptr; int size; ; | xsd base64Binary | xsd base64Binary
