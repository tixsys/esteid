libDigiDoc
==========

libDigiDoc is a library implementing a subset of the XAdES digital
signature standard on top of Estonian specific .ddoc container format.
It allows to create, sign, verify, and modify digidoc XML containers.

The library dates back to times when there were no proper XML to
code binding generators and is thus a complete mess of printf-s.
It is only used by the libdigidocpp library for handling .ddoc
files in order to ensure a bug-by-bug compatibility with old software.

THIS LIBRARY IS OBSOLETE. PLEASE DO NOT USE IT FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
